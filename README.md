# Lyric Match - AI-Powered Song Guessing Game

## üéµ Overview
Lyric Match is a web application where users guess the song title based on a short AI-generated lyric snippet. The application utilizes **React.js** for the frontend, **Node.js (Express.js)** for the backend, and **Google's Gemini AI** for lyric generation.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Generate Lyric Snippet**: Click a button to get a random snippet from an English song.
- **Enter Guess**: Users type their guess for the song title.
- **Check Answer**: The app validates the user's guess and provides feedback.
- **AI-Powered Lyrics**: Uses **Google's Gemini AI** to generate lyrics without revealing the song title.
